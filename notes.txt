// TO BE DONE 
8. Scale to same size feature 
// bind the mismatch percentage  
// add error pixel transforms to images 


//optimization : it takes lot for the compare pixels fnction at the root lvl 
1. cache antialising resluts for the image 
2. cache ignoreBoxes/ boundingBoxes resutls for every pixel so that we dont loop everytime over the results
// later on optimizations 
1. multithtreading for parellel loops 
2. work around with LCS mutlitthreading algorithm


#### TO DISCUSS :
// which image to clone for result image ::: discussion  
// work on input handling for the code  ::: discussion (backward compatibility)
// some things around algorithm 
discuss about height > 200 optimization  ::: discussion 


// non primitive features
9.2: Add largeImage handling (as we have to use canvas)
10. Unit Tests 
11. Logging Framework 
12. Error Handling Framework
// check for memory leaks etc issues 
// font smoothing corrections 
// floating regions feature 
// points of mismatch feature (red animation)
// origin shift for ignore Draw 
// error handling for ignoreDraw ( overall a strong error handling over complete code review )
